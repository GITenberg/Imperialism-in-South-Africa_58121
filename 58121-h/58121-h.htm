5</span>IMPERIALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA.</h2>
<h3>ANNEXATION OF THE TRANSVAAL.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is vain to dispute the fact that
those Puritan Fathers&mdash;who, upon one occasion, held a
meeting, and resolved first that the earth was the Lord&rsquo;s,
and the fulness thereof; secondly, that it was the heritage of
the saints; and that thirdly, they were the saints, and were,
therefore, justified in depriving the natives of their grounds,
and in taking possession of them themselves&mdash;had a full
share of that English faculty of appropriation which has made
England the mistress of the seas, and for a while, almost, the
ruler of the world; and, as Englishmen, we cannot say that on the
whole that wholesale system, which has planted the British flag
in every quarter of the globe, has been disastrous to the
communities ruled over, or dishonourable to the nation
itself.&nbsp; In some cases undoubtedly we have acted unjustly;
in some cases the lives and happiness of millions have been
placed in incompetent hands; in some cases we have had selfish
rulers and incapable officers; but India and Canada and the West
Indian Islands and Australia and New Zealand are the better for
our rule.&nbsp; An Englishman may well be proud of what his
countrymen have done, and it becomes us to review the past in no
narrow, carping, and censorious spirit.&nbsp; We have spent money
by millions, but then we are rich, and the expenditure has not
been an unproductive one.&nbsp; We have sacrificed valuable
lives, but the men who have fallen have been embalmed in the
nation&rsquo;s memory, and the story of their heroism will mould
the character and fire the ambition and arouse the sympathies of
our children&rsquo;s children, as they did those of our fathers
in days gone by; and yet there is a danger lest we undertake
responsibilities beyond our means, and find ourselves engaged in
contests utterly needless in the circumstances of the case, and
certain to result in a vain effusion of blood and expenditure of
money.&nbsp; As far as South Africa is concerned, this is
emphatically the case.&nbsp; Originally the Cape Settlement was
but a fort for the <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>the coast.&nbsp; The country is subject to drought, and
seems chiefly to be inhabited by diamond diggers, ostrich
farmers, and wool growers.&nbsp; Its great agricultural resources
are undeveloped, because labour is dear, and all carriage to the
coast is expensive.&nbsp; The English never stop in the colonies,
but return to England as soon as they have made a fortune.&nbsp;
Living is quite as dear as in England, and in many parts
dearer.&nbsp; In the Cape Colony, the chief amusements of all
classes are riding, driving, shooting, and billiards.&nbsp; In
the interior there are fine views to be seen, and in some
quarters an abundance of game.&nbsp; The thunderstorms are
frightful, the rivers, dry in summer, are torrents in
winter.&nbsp; The droughts, the snakes, the red soil dust, and
the Kaffirs, are a perpetual nuisance to all decent people.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Although South Africa is a rising colony,&rdquo; writes
Sir Arthur Cunynghame, &ldquo;I hardly think it offers to the
emigrant the chances which he would obtain in Australia or New
Zealand.&nbsp; South Africa is not a very rich country.&nbsp;
Labour is hard to obtain, and it will be years before irrigation
can be carried on a sufficient scale to make agriculture a
brilliant Success.&nbsp; Nevertheless, land is so abundant that
the energetic colonist is sure, at least, to make a living, and
provided he does not drink, has a good chance of becoming a rich
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; A great deal of money is made by ostrich
farming and sheep grazing, but they are occupations which require
capital.&nbsp; As to cereals, it pays better to buy them than to
grow them.&nbsp; A cabbage appears to be a costly luxury, and the
price of butter is almost prohibitive.&nbsp; &ldquo;South
Africa,&rdquo; wrote a <i>Saturday Reviewer</i> recently,
&ldquo;is the paradise of hunters, and the purgatory of
colonists.&rdquo;&nbsp; The remark is not exactly true, but for
all practical purposes it may be accepted as the truth.&nbsp; If
this be so, how is it, then, it may be asked, we English have
been so anxious to get possession of the country?&nbsp; The
answer is, We hold the Cape of Good Hope to be desirable as a
port of call and harbour of refuge on our way to India; but the
opening of the Suez Canal has changed all that, and the reason
for which we took it from the Dutch in 1806 does not exist
now.&nbsp; Whether the country has ever made a penny by the Cape
remains to be proved.</p>
<p>In taking possession of the Cape of Good Hope, we found there
a people whom we have annexed against their will, and of whom we
have made bitter enemies.&nbsp; These were the original Dutch
settlers, or Boers, a primitive, pastoral people, with a good
deal of the piety of the Pilgrim Fathers, and who set to work to
exterminate the pagans much after the fashion of the Jews, of
whom we read in the Old Testament.&nbsp; Their plan of getting
rid of the native difficulty was a very effective one.&nbsp; They
either made the native a slave, or they drove him away.&nbsp; Mr.
Thomas Pringle, one of our earliest colonists, says, &ldquo;Their
demeanour towards us, whom they <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>might be supposed naturally to regard
with exceeding jealousy, if not dislike, was more friendly and
obliging than could, under all the circumstances, have been
expected.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were, he says, uncultivated, but not
disagreeable, neighbours, exceedingly shrewd at bargain making;
but they were civil and good-natured, and, according to the
custom of the country, extremely hospitable; and the same
testimony has been borne to them by later travellers.&nbsp; They
lived as farmers, and the life agreed with them.&nbsp; The men
are finely made, and out of them a grand empire might be
raised.&nbsp; In 1815 they made an effort to shake off the
British yoke.&nbsp; A Hottentot, named Booy, appeared at the
magistrate&rsquo;s office at Cradock, and complained of the
oppressive conduct of a Boer of the name of Frederick
Bezuidenhout.&nbsp; Inquiry was accordingly made.&nbsp; The Boer
admitted the facts, but, instead of yielding to the
magistrate&rsquo;s order, he boldly declared that he considered
this interference between himself and his Hottentot to be a
presumptuous innovation upon his rights, and an intolerable
usurpation of authority.&nbsp; He told the field-cornet that he
set at defiance both himself and the magistrate who had sent him
on this officious errand, and, to give further emphasis to his
words, he fell violently upon poor Boor, gave him a severe
beating, and then bade him go and tell the civil authorities that
he would treat them in the same manner if they should dare to
come upon his grounds to claim the property of a Hottentot.&nbsp;
It must be remembered that when the Boers were handed over to us,
without their leave or without their consent being in any way
asked, each Boer had perfect control over the liberty and life
and limb of every Hottentot under his control.&nbsp; It was only
thus he believed his property was safe, and his throat
uncut.&nbsp; But to return to Bezuidenhout.&nbsp; The Cape
Government could not allow his defiance to pass unheeded.&nbsp;
An expedition was sent out against him, and he was shot.&nbsp;
The affair excited a great sensation in the country.&nbsp; At a
numerous assemblage of the Boers in the neighbourhood, it was
resolved to revenge his death.&nbsp; They did more; they resolved
to be independent of the hateful British yoke; but, it is
needless to add, in vain.&nbsp; England, after putting down
Napoleon, and triumphing at Waterloo, was in no mood to be defied
by a handful of Dutch farmers in a distant quarter of the
globe.&nbsp; But the Cape Government had Kaffir wars to fight,
and they could not afford to treat the Boers as absolute enemies,
and they were rewarded with a large portion of the territory, won
from the Kaffirs in 1819.&nbsp; But this was not sufficient for
their earth-hunger.&nbsp; They crossed the boundaries, and, with
their lives in their hands, planted themselves among the
savages.&nbsp; In 1838 they went off still further from British
rule.&nbsp; In that year the slaves were manumitted, and a sum of
money was voted as a compensation to <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the Boers.&nbsp; To the shame of the
British Government, it must be confessed that the equivalent was
never paid them.&nbsp; Despairing of ever receiving it, they sold
their rights to Jews and middlemen, and trekked far out into the
country into the districts known as Griqualand, Natal, the Orange
Free State, and the Transvaal.&nbsp; It is because we have
followed them there, when there was no need to have done so, that
we are now engaged in a costly and bloody war.&nbsp; First we
seized Natal; then we took possession of the Diamond Fields, and
our last act was the annexation of the Transvaal.&nbsp; How far
this system of annexation is to spread, it is impossible to
say.&nbsp; It is equally impossible to state what will be its
cost in treasure and in men.&nbsp; It seems equally difficult to
say upon whom the blame of this annexation system rests.&nbsp; It
really seems as if we were villains, as Shakespeare says, by
necessity and fools by a divine thrusting on.&nbsp; We should
have left the Boers alone.&nbsp; They were not British subjects,
and did not want to be such.&nbsp; Natal was not British
territory when they settled there, neither was the Orange Free
State Territory; and, at any rate, in 1854 their independence,
which had been persistently fought for, and nobly won, was
acknowledged by the British Government as regards the Orange Free
State and the Transvaal.&nbsp; Surely in South Africa there was
room for the Englishman and the Boer, and if it had not been for
the dream of Imperialism, which seems to dominate the brain of
our colonial rulers, the two nations might have lived and
flourished side by side.&nbsp; The Boer, at any rate, has made
himself at home on the soil.&nbsp; It agrees with him
physically.&nbsp; In the Orange State and the Transvaal he made
good roads, and built churches and schools and gaols, and turned
the wilderness into a fruitful field.&nbsp; In reply to the
English who pleaded for annexation, he said, &ldquo;We fled from
you years ago; leave us in peace.&nbsp; We shall pay our debts
early enough; your presence can but tend to increase them, and to
drive us through fresh wanderings, through new years of bloodshed
and misery, to seek homes whither you will no longer follow
us.&nbsp; We conquered and peopled Natal; you reaped the fruits
of that conquest.&nbsp; What have you done for that colony?&nbsp;
Do you seek to do with our Transvaal as you have done with it, to
make our land a place of abomination, defiled with female
slavery, reeking with paganism, and likely, as Natal is, only too
soon to be red with blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Transvaal,&rdquo; wrote one who knew South Africa
well&mdash;the late Mr. Thomas Baines&mdash;&ldquo;will yet
command the admiration of the world for the perseverance, the
primitive manliness and hardihood of its pioneers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As a proof of advancing prosperity, when he was there in 1860 its
one-pound notes had risen in value till four were taken for a
sovereign, and several hundred pounds&rsquo; worth <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>had been called
in and publicly burnt upon the market-place.&nbsp; It is a proof
of the simplicity of the people that on that occasion the Boers
and Doppers (adult Baptists) crowded wrathfully around, and
bitterly commented on the wastefulness of their Government in
wickedly destroying so much of the money of their Republic; while
others, of more advanced views, discussed the means of raising
them still further in value, and sagely remarked that because
they had been printed in Holland the English would not take them,
but that if others were printed in London they would certainly be
as good as a Bank of England note.&nbsp; In the Volksraad (House
of Commons) now and then some amusing scenes occurred.&nbsp; The
progressive party wanted, one day, to pass some measure for the
opening and improvement of the country, when the opponents,
finding themselves in a minority, thought to put the drag on by
bringing forward an old law that all members should be attired in
black cloth suits and white neckerchiefs.&nbsp; This had the
immediate effect of disqualifying so many that the business of
the House could not be legally conducted; but an English member
who lived next door, slipped out, donned his Sunday best, with a
collar and tie worthy of a Christy Minstrel, and resumed his
sitting with an army that completely dismayed the
anti-progressionists.&nbsp; The latest authority, Sir Arthur
Cunynghame, testifies to this simplicity as still the
characteristic of the Dutch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some little time before
our arrival,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;a German conjurer had
visited this distant little village, when the Doppers were so
alarmed at his tricks that they left the room in which he was
exhibiting, and, assembling in prayer, entreated to be relieved
of the devil who had come amongst them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He tells the
story of a Jew, who in dealing with a Boer had made a
miscalculation, which the Boer pointed out, appealing to his
ready-reckoner.&nbsp; Not in the least taken aback, the Israelite
replied, &ldquo;Oh, this is a ready-reckoner of last year!&rdquo;
and the poor Boer was done.&nbsp; A further illustration of their
simplicity is to be found in the fact that when they trekked from
the Cape they fancied that they were on their way to Egypt, and,
having reached in the Transvaal a considerable river which falls
into the Limpopo, thought they were there, and called it the
Nyl&mdash;a name which it still retains.&nbsp; In accordance with
their serious teaching, they gave Scriptural names to their
settlements and villages; and if they were severe on the natives,
and ruled them with a rod of iron, did not the Jews act in a
similar manner to the Hivites and the Hittites, and did not
Samuel command Saul to hew Agag in pieces before the Lord?</p>
<p>It is to be feared that the Boers have never had justice done
to them by our rulers.&nbsp; We had no claim on them.&nbsp; It
was to escape British rule that they, with their wives and
children, their <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>men-servants and maid-servants, their oxen, and their
sheep, their horses and their asses, went forth into the
wilderness.&nbsp; Even Mr. Trollope admits that when they took
possession of Natal, &ldquo;there was hardly a native to be seen,
the country having been desolated by the King of the Zulus.&nbsp;
It was the very place for the Dutch, fertile without
interference, and with space for every one.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
they would have settled, as did the Pilgrim Fathers on the other
side of the Atlantic, and built up a flourishing State, but we
followed them, and drove them away.&nbsp; If they had been
allowed to remain, the English Government and the English people
would have been saved a good deal of trouble.&nbsp; At any rate,
we should never have heard of the native difficulty in
Natal&mdash;the difficulty which keeps away the emigration
required to develop the resources of a country happily situated
in many respects; the difficulty which must ever be felt by a
handful of English in the presence of a horde of polygamous and
untutored savages who will not work, and who, alas! are not
ashamed to beg.&nbsp; Natal, had the Dutch been left peaceably in
possession of it, would have been by this time the home of a
God-fearing, civilised community, instead of swarming with Pagans
who have fled there from the cruelties of their native kings, and
who learn to treat their protectors with insolent contempt.&nbsp;
In Natal, the English shopkeeper has to speak to his customers in
their own language.&nbsp; Where the Boers hold sway it is
otherwise.&nbsp; In the Dutch parts of the Cape Colony, Captain
Aylward writes: &ldquo;The coloured people are tame, submissive,
and industrious, speaking the language of their instructors and
natural masters.&nbsp; As I proceeded further on my journey
through the Transvaal,&rdquo; continues the same writer, &ldquo;I
saw in various directions gardens, fruitful orchards, and small,
square houses in the possession of blacks, who were living in a
condition of ordinary propriety, having abandoned polygamy and
other horrid customs resulting from it.&nbsp; So great an
improvement I had not noticed during any part of my previous
residence in Natal.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a pity that we have made
the Boers our enemies; and the worst of it is, in their
determination not to be English the women, according to Captain
Aylward, have been a wonderful aid to the men.&nbsp; They have
suffered for that spirit.&nbsp; It has called them from the
homesteads built by their fathers, the rich lands where the
grapes clustered and the sheep fattened, and the fields were
white for the harvest.&nbsp; In 1841 Major Charteris wrote:
&ldquo;The spirit of dislike to English rule was remarkably
dominant among the women.&nbsp; Many of those who had formerly
lived in affluence but were now in comparative want, and subject
to all the inconveniences accompanying the insecure state in
which they were existing, having lost, moreover, their husbands
and brothers by the savage, still rejected with <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>scorn the
idea of returning to the colony.&nbsp; If any of the men began to
drop or lose courage they urged them on to fresh exertions, and
kept alive the spirit of resistance within them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir
Arthur Cunynghame has nothing but praise for the Boers.&nbsp; On
his way to the Diamond Fields he stopped at Hanover, which, he
says, &ldquo;has a grand appearance, the Dutch minister&rsquo;s
house, standing in the centre, being quite a palace.&nbsp; It was
built by the subscriptions of his parishioners.&nbsp; The honours
which the Dutch lavish on the ministry are worthy of
remark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Equally worthy of remark is their
hospitality and their piety.&nbsp; The farmer gives his guest the
best entertainment he can provide, and &ldquo;before the family
retires to rest the large Bible is opened and the chapter
appropriate to the day is read.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another occasion,
Sir Arthur&rsquo;s party encamp near the residence of a rich
Dutch farmer, who refused admission to his house and would not
even sell them an egg; yet he records the fact that, &ldquo;late
in the evening the sounds of the Evening Hymn floated over the
plain, the nasal twang of the patriarch being distinctly heard
leading the choir, while female voices, with their plaintive
notes, chimed in.&nbsp; It is pleasant,&rdquo; adds Sir Arthur,
&ldquo;to hear in these lone lands such evidence of a religions
sentiment pervading the community, and it is an assurance that
the people are contented and happy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Arthur
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;There are no finer young men in the world
than the young Dutch Boers, who are generally of immense height
and size, and very hardy.&nbsp; Their life is spent in the open
air by day, and frequently at night they sleep on the veldt, with
no tent or covering.&nbsp; Men more fit for the Grenadier Guards,
as to personal appearance, could not be found.&nbsp; Some of them
are plucky.&nbsp; A Boer had part of his hand blown off by the
bursting of his gun.&nbsp; Having no doctor near, he directed his
son to bring his hammer and chisel, and shape off his
fingers.&rdquo;&nbsp; As an Irishman, Captain Aylward is
enthusiastic as regards the personal charms of the ladies.&nbsp;
Many of the elder ones even, he admits, are not uncomely, and in
the wild neighbourhood of Lydenberg itself, he tells us, are to
be seen some bearing traces of beauty of no ordinary character,
whose lives, he says, somewhat unnecessarily, are useful,
adorning, and cheering the homes of their husbands and
children.&nbsp; These people are somewhat unlettered, and very
phlegmatic.&nbsp; &ldquo;They do not wish,&rdquo; writes Sir
Arthur Cunynghame, &ldquo;to move ten miles from their own door,
nor to see one who comes from ten miles beyond it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Their moral discipline also seems somewhat severe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the little fort,&rdquo; writes Captain Aylward,
&ldquo;was an English storekeeper, named Glynn, whose daughters
had a piano, on which they would occasionally play dance and
other profane music.&nbsp; This was a source of great annoyance
to their pious neighbours, who, in many respects, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>resembled our
early Puritans.&nbsp; It was requested that the piano should be
silenced, as the music might tempt the anger of Heaven if
persisted in during a time of war and trial.&nbsp; If a girl in
the laager were frivolous or light in her conduct, she was liable
to be arrested, and brought for trial before the Fathers of the
Church, from whom she might receive a severe caution, or even the
punishment of removal.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Lydenberg, at the time of
Sir Arthur&rsquo;s visit, an altercation had taken place on the
unrighteousness of dancing, for which a party was tried by the
Synod; but an appeal was made to the Court, and this appeal
formed an important epoch in the history of the town.&nbsp; To
show how primitive these Boers are, let us take the following
story:&mdash;A schoolmaster was lately appointed in
Zoutspanberg.&nbsp; One of his earliest lessons was to teach the
children that the world turned upon its own axis.&nbsp; He also
endeavoured to make them understand the revolutions of the
heavenly bodies.&nbsp; The children went home, and were
impertinent to their parents, and told them that the earth went
round the sun.&nbsp; The elders of the district met, and
consulted regarding these new doctrines, and finally agreed to
refer the subject to the minister, who requested the schoolmaster
to explain.&nbsp; The schoolmaster said, &ldquo;I teach them
nothing but the movements of the heavenly bodies, and that the
earth revolves round the sun.&rdquo;&nbsp; The minister answered,
&ldquo;Well, this may be true, no doubt, and what the earth does
in Holland; but it would be more convenient at present if in the
Zoutspanberg you would allow the sun still to go round the earth
for a few years longer.&nbsp; We do not like sudden changes in
such matters.&rdquo;&nbsp; The schoolmaster took the hint, and
the sun continued to go round the earth as usual.&nbsp; The power
of the minister of a parish is very great.&nbsp; A great deal
depends upon him for the improvement and well-being of the
town.&nbsp; Many a time it was said to Sir Arthur, when he
observed that a town was flourishing, &ldquo;Yes, we are
fortunate in our minister;&rdquo; and when it was falling back it
was, &ldquo;Ah! all will alter when we get rid of our present
minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to the credit of these people that they have a
consistent native policy.&nbsp; No faith is to be held with
Rome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Delenda est Carthago&rdquo; is their
motto.&nbsp; They leave the natives to quarrel among themselves,
while our English policy has been to play off one petty savage
chief against another, and to arm and strengthen the natives with
whom we are ultimately to fight.&nbsp; The natives see through
this, and argue, as Sir Arthur Cunynghame testifies, that the
English fear them, else why, they ask, do they give them such
high wages? or why do the Government allow them to buy
arms?&nbsp; It is some such feeling that has urged on Cetewayo
into his present hostile attitude.&nbsp; He considered that we
were his <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>allies against the Boers, and thought we annexed the
Transvaal for him and his savage followers.&nbsp; Up to the
annexation he and the English were on friendly terms.&nbsp; It
seems that the Boers are reluctant to fight for English rule, and
some of the colonial papers hint that they are a danger and a
menace.&nbsp; No wonder, as we have always sacrificed them to the
natives.&nbsp; The Free States newspaper complains that
&ldquo;our British neighbours have established at the Diamond
Fields free trade in guns and ammunition, in spite of all
treaties with the Republic, and even in spite of their own
professed policy in the Cape Colony.&nbsp; Griqualand West
permits the supply of guns and ammunition to the
natives&mdash;Zulus and Basutos&mdash;without hindrance, whilst
Earl Carnarvon requests all South Africa to meet in a friendly
conference, because of the native question and Zulu
difficulty.&nbsp; British traders supply Her Majesty&rsquo;s
enemies, and our enemies too, with guns and ammunition to any
extent, in order that these enemies may be better prepared to
fight us when the next struggle may commence; and, worst of all,
British commerce, represented by colonial shopkeepers and
merchants, who, to fill their own pockets, would not for a moment
hesitate to bring ruin on the colonial farmers and Republican
Boers, cry out that it is preposterous to stop the trade in
guns.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assuredly, the Boers may well complain of the
Imperial policy in South Africa.&nbsp; There is little to be said
for our dealings with them after they had removed out of our
rule.&nbsp; That we had no right to annex the Diamond Fields, the
sum we offered in compensation may be considered as fair
evidence; and the annexation of the Transvaal, besides being a
crime, was a blunder for which we are now paying dearly in person
and in purse.&nbsp; It has bean shown that the cry for annexation
raised was merely &ldquo;an ignorant expression of the
dissatisfaction of a mean and contemptible
minority&rdquo;&mdash;a set of greedy speculators and
disreputable office-seekers, who grossly deceived the English
officials, who were not naturally averse to the power and
prestige a new command would give them.&nbsp; The Republic was
not insolvent, nor was it unable to hold its own.&nbsp; In the
war with the Basutos, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Trollope,
the Burghers were everywhere victorious, nor was it stained with
slavery, as, if so, when Sir Theophilus Shepstone annexed it, we
should have heard of a wholesale emancipation; nor was the step
taken by the will of the people.&nbsp; The only argument for the
step was that we were obliged to take it in order to prevent our
own house catching fire, and the result has been the
conflagration we were so anxious to avoid.&nbsp; Sir Theophilus
Shepstone annexed the Transvaal, and our house caught fire in the
Cape Colony, and in Griqualand West, and Secocoeni broke out;
and, lastly, we have the tragedy of Isandula.&nbsp; We shall
never be safe till we have the <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Transvaal, argued Sir Theophilus
Shepstone and his friends.&nbsp; Now, argue the latter, that we
have the Transvaal, we are bound to go to war.&nbsp; This
reasoning was irresistible to Lord Chelmsford, who, in a despatch
dated September last, says, &ldquo;So long as Natal and the
Transvaal had separate interests, the policy of the chief of the
Zulu nation was to play off the former against the latter. . .
.&nbsp; With the annexation of the Transvaal this state of things
virtually came to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ex uno disce omnes</i>.&nbsp; One example will suffice of
the way in which that theory of dominion universal, from, the
Cape to the Zambesi, which appears to dominate over the official
Englishman, when he has anything to do with Africa, acts in a
mischievous manner, may be seen in the case of Griqualand East,
formerly called No Man&rsquo;s Land, which was some years since a
sort of neutral territory.&nbsp; In time the Griquas, or
bastards, settled there.&nbsp; They were an industrious people,
and far more advanced in civilisation than any other native
tribe.&nbsp; They had large flocks of cattle and sheep, and were
wealthy, with good furniture and houses, and prospered under the
rule of their President, Adam Kok.&nbsp; Many new buildings, such
as churches and schools, were being erected when Sir Arthur
Cunynghame visited them, and many new stores put up.&nbsp; He
writes: &ldquo;In the afternoon we attended the native service
carried on in the Dutch language.&nbsp; It was impossible for me
to follow it; in fact, the discovery that the sermon related to
the Prodigal Son formed the limit of my knowledge of what was
going on.&nbsp; The congregation appeared attentive, and the
clergyman in earnest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not long after the visit, it
was decided by the British that they should annex the country,
and Adam Kok was pensioned off with a thousand a year, which he
did not, however, long enjoy, as he was soon killed by a carriage
accident.&nbsp; At a meeting of the people on the subject,
Captain Adam Kok complained, as, indeed, he had every reason to
do, of the hasty and arbitrary manner in which Government were
assuming authority in his country.&nbsp; They had their own
cannon, fire-arms, and ammunition, bought with their own money,
and after being left for thirteen years entirely to their own
resources, without any preliminary notice he said, the Cape
Government stepped coolly in and took possession of them and
their property.&nbsp; When the Government laid out the Kat River
Settlement of Hottentots, they gave the settlers seed, corn,
ploughs, and various other things to help them.&nbsp; But the
Griquas were not so treated.&nbsp; They had to do everything for
themselves, and we were bound to regard them not as enemies to be
put down, but as friendly allies to be encouraged and
preserved.</p>
<p>How long is this system to be pursued?&nbsp; The Transvaal is
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>getting
into a worse state every day.&nbsp; It has vast resources which
cannot be developed.&nbsp; It is importing flour, when it might
be a great corn-producing country.&nbsp; It has no manufactures,
and its exports are few.&nbsp; Captain Aylward writes: &ldquo;The
Boer party complain bitterly of the annexation.&nbsp; They say
our liberties have been unnecessarily taken from us, and our
country annexed, not only against the will of the majority, but
in utter defiance of Lord Carnarvon&rsquo;s instructions, which
state that no such proclamation shall be issued by you (Sir
Theophilus Shepstone), unless you shall be certain that the
inhabitants, or a sufficient number of them, or the Legislature,
desire to become our subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Boers also object
to the annexation, because they believe that the arguments put
forward by Sir Theophilus Shepstone are not borne out by facts,
and they are still more angry because they believe the annexation
was brought about by false pretences, accompanied and
strengthened by attacks made upon their honour and character by a
party Press interested in their destruction.&nbsp; They say
further, that the terms of the Annexation Proclamation have not
been adhered to, and this party, undoubtedly the strongest in the
country, appeals to England to do them justice and restore to
them their country.&nbsp; The railway party who want a connection
with the natural outlet of the Transvaal, Delagoa Bay, are
discontented, and so are the very men who were the first to
applaud annexation.&nbsp; As it is, it seems, the Transvaal must
end either in anarchy or martial law, and will be a heavy burden
on the British taxpayer for many years to come.&nbsp; Mr.
Trollops himself admits that it is not easy to justify what we
have done in the Transvaal.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there be,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;any laws of right and wrong, by which nations
should govern themselves in their dealings with other nations, it
is hard to find the law in conformity with which that act was
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Trollope is right.&nbsp; Undoubtedly
it was an act of injustice of which we have not yet seen the
bitter end.&nbsp; There is little chance of that injustice being
undone.&nbsp; The Dutch are poor and far away.&nbsp; It is the
old, old story of the wolf and the lamb over again.&nbsp; We have
made so little of South Africa, we might leave the Boers
alone.&nbsp; All that we can say against them is that when it was
the fashion for West Indian planters to maltreat their slaves,
they often did the same.</p>
<p>The Boers are becoming more discontented, as well they may,
and there is no sign of this discontent ceasing.&nbsp; In the
beginning of February they held a large meeting at Wonderfontein
to receive the report of the visit of the deputation, Messrs.
Kruger and Joubert, to Europe.&nbsp; The latter is reported to
have said:&mdash;&ldquo;My brethren and
fellow-countrymen,&mdash;I am very glad to see you all spared by
God in this our beloved country.&nbsp; I wish <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and hope the
best, also, with regard to your families.&nbsp; You have deputed
us on a mission of the utmost importance to yourselves.&nbsp; I
know you are awaiting our report with deep anxiety.&nbsp; I know
your feelings and your wishes&mdash;aye, I share your anxiety,
and, therefore, <i>I</i> will not detain you long by words.&nbsp;
Know, then, that I cannot report to you so favourably as you had
expected that the all-powerful British Empire had acknowledged
your rights so that you may, as had been said by Joshua to Caleb,
be strong and possess the country which God has given you.&nbsp;
No, brethren, England has annexed your country, and will keep it,
and I may not mislead you by not telling you that you cannot stop
the superior power of England.&nbsp; Therefore, take heed for
yourselves, and don&rsquo;t do anything of which you may repent
for ever, and which may plunge yourselves, your families, and
others into deeper misery still.&nbsp; Pray to God for wisdom; be
prudent, and act wisely.&nbsp; Who knows, God may help us and
grant relief.&nbsp; You had sent us to ask back your
independence.&nbsp; What we have done for it you already know
from the newspapers, and the rest you will learn from the books
or pamphlets which we had printed.&nbsp; In how far you will
decide that we have done our duty we leave to you.&nbsp; I do not
care for myself, but I do for the country, and the people, and
where I feel my own shortcomings and weakness, I am satisfied
before God and my conscience that I, if <i>I</i> have not
obtained what you, what I, and the people have desired, I have
done for it what I could.&nbsp; And with this I wish God&rsquo;s
greatest blessing for yourselves and the country.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Other speeches were delivered of a more angry and exciting
character.&nbsp; It was intimated that we got our Empire by
robbery.&nbsp; Mr. W. Pretorious said the High Commissioner
promised much, but all he wanted was to get back his
independence.&nbsp; Said another speaker, amidst enthusiastic
cheers, England might annex and oppress them, but it could never
give them an English heart.&nbsp; Some resolutions were moved, of
which the following was one:&mdash;&ldquo;The committee,
supported by the people, cannot be satisfied with the reply of
the English Minister, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and resolve to
continue to protest against the injustice committed, and,
further, to devise ways and means with the people for attaining
their object.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the meeting, some people having
torn to pieces the printed copies of Sir Bartle Frere&rsquo;s
letter, Mr. Joubert strongly condemned the stupid proceedings,
and requested the people to act wisely and with judgment.&nbsp;
On the Sunday religious services were held, and on Monday a
further meeting took place.&nbsp; Ultimately it was resolved,
&ldquo;That the committee, having learned the opinion of the
people expressed in their memorials, and the expressed wish of
the people not to submit to British supremacy, but to abide by
the protest of April 11, 1877, proposes to the committee <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>a deputation
to acquaint Sir Bartle Frere therewith, and at the same time to
assure His Excellency of their full co-operation for the
advancement of the whole of South Africa, provided the annexation
be rescinded.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clearly, when we have settled with
Cetewayo, we shall have a little trouble with the free people of
the Transvaal.&nbsp; According to the <i>Natal Mercury</i>, we
had better leave them alone.</p>
<p>The following, says the <i>Natal Witness</i>, is a translation
of the oath of mutual allegiance taken by a great number of
respectable Transvaal Boers at the Wonderfontein meeting.&nbsp;
It will strike most people that this oath is the oath of men who
are to be respected.&nbsp; It will also strike them that such men
are likely to secure the sympathy of the great bulk of the
English nation:&mdash;&ldquo;In the presence of Almighty God, the
Searcher of hearts, and praying for His gracious assistance and
mercy, we, burghers of the South African Republic, have solemnly
agreed, for us and for our children, to unite in a holy covenant,
which we confirm with a solemn oath.&nbsp; It is now forty years
ago since our fathers left the Cape Colony to become a free and
independent people.&nbsp; These forty years were forty years of
sorrow and suffering.&nbsp; We have founded Natal, the Orange
Free State, and the South African Republic, and three times has
the English Government trampled on our liberty.&nbsp; And our
flag, baptized with the blood and tears of our fathers, has been
pulled down.&nbsp; As by a thief in the night has our free
Republic been stolen from us.&nbsp; We cannot suffer this and we
may not.&nbsp; It is the will of God that the unity of our
fathers and the love to our children should oblige us to deliver
unto our children, unblemished, the heritage of our
fathers.&nbsp; It is for this reason that we here unite, and give
each other the hand as men and brethren, solemnly promising to be
faithful to our country and people, and looking unto God, to work
together unto death for the restoration of the liberty of our
Republic.&nbsp; So truly help us, God Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Till Sir Bartle Frere appeared upon the scene at the Cape men
ridiculed the idea of another Kaffir war.&nbsp; Now all is
changed.&nbsp; The following is an extract from a letter, dated
February 12, received by a gentleman in London from a well-known
merchant at the Cape:&mdash;&ldquo;Who is responsible for the
fearful loss of life which has taken place in Zululand?&nbsp;
This is now the question of all questions; but we fear that it
will drop out of sight, as the iniquitous proceedings perpetrated
here during the late so-called war have done.&nbsp; The Zulus
will, of course, be crushed, as &lsquo;Might is Right&rsquo;
seems now to be England&rsquo;s motto.&nbsp; Sir Bartle Frere and
Lord Chelmsford must answer for the part they have played, and
for the consequences of the tragedy they have caused.&nbsp; Never
was there a greater mistake than the Frere-Sprigg native
policy.&nbsp; We have not right on our side, and we have not the
force to carry it <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>out, even if we had.&nbsp; We have made enemies of the
loyal Gaikas, of the Basutos, of the Fingoes, of the Zulus, and
of every other tribe in South Africa, by our harsh and unjust
treatment of them.&nbsp; The appointment of Sir Bartle Frere as
Governor, and of Mr. Sprigg and his party to power, are the
greatest misfortunes which have befallen this country for fifty
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The South African correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>,
writing from Maritzburg, March 2, says:&mdash;&ldquo;It is now
only too evident to every one that Sir Bartle Frere&rsquo;s
policy has been most mischievous in its effects upon South
African interests.&nbsp; More has been done since he landed at
Capetown, two years ago, to produce discord and unsettlement
than, it is to be feared, can be undone for many years to
come.&nbsp; Friendly tribes have been exasperated; colonists have
been ridden over rough-shod, and now it would seem that the High
Commissioner is bent on bringing about the last and final evil,
by engaging in a war of conquest with the Transvaal Boers.&nbsp;
There is a strong and increasing feeling throughout South Africa
that the annexation of the Transvaal must be reversed.&nbsp; When
that act took place it met with very wide approval, for two
reasons&mdash;first, because it was believed that the majority of
the Boers were consenting parties; and next, because it was
believed that the act might tend to bring the two great European
nationalities closer together.&nbsp; The return of the second
Transvaal deputation has brought to light the fact that the
majority of the Boers were by no means consenting parties.&nbsp;
They complain, too, and justly, that not one of the promises made
at the time of the annexation has been fulfilled.&nbsp; If the
acts of the annexation were repealed, and time allowed for the
bitter feelings engendered by it to subside, there is little
doubt that the Boers would be found willing to come into some
sort of confederation with the other South African States, and
there can be no doubt that if the Transvaal came in willingly the
Free State, whose capital, Bloemfontein, is regarded by many as
the natural capital of South Africa, would come in
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is to be the end of our system of annexation in South
Africa?&nbsp; Our Consuls far away from the healthy criticism of
the English Press, and possibly better trained in ancient than
modern history, dream imperial dreams, and the public at home
applauds when a magnificent success crowns their work.&nbsp; In
the case of Sir Bartle Frere there has been a failure, and he
will have to pay the penalty; while demagogues who, like the
Irishman who when landed in America, and asked for his vote for
the opposition candidate, immediately promised it, remarking he
was &ldquo;again all Government,&rdquo; see in the failure the
hand of Earl Beaconsfield, and hold him up to scorn and
contempt.&nbsp; It is clear what has <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>been done at the Cape is only in
accordance with the whole past of colonial rule, not merely
there, but in every quarter of the globe.&nbsp; We could not
leave the Boers alone, who stood as buffers between us and the
surrounding savages.&nbsp; We must follow them over desert and
plain and swamp and river and rock and bush.&nbsp; The colonist
reaped, at any rate, a benefit from such a policy, for he made
profitable contracts for his waggons and horses, and there was a
refreshing stream of English gold, which otherwise would have
been dried up.&nbsp; The Book of Nature might say, Leave the
Boers and the savages alone; but to a highly-cultured people the
Book of Nature is a blank, and the passions and prejudices, and
fears and hopes, of the passing hour are the only considerations
by which the public and the puppets it places in office are
moved.&nbsp; Some of us still talk of the New Testament; but he
who were to quote it, even after Mr. Speaker had said the
prayers, in our High Court of Parliament, as bearing in any way
on national policy, would be as much laughed at as Dr. Kenealy or
Major O&rsquo;Gorman.&nbsp; Meanwhile time will solve the
problem&mdash;the storm will blow over.&nbsp; The mob and the
pictorial papers will glorify the returning heroes who have
crushed a savage who was mad enough to defy on his own behalf and
on that of his people the British power, and the British public
will have to pay the bill&mdash;not, unfortunately, the
hard-working, over-taxed working man; he is a myth, as much so as
a mermaid or a griffin; but that large middle-class, on whom the
tax-gatherer instinctively preys; who have been shorn so often
that it has become to them a second nature; who have been the
mainstay of the country, but who are fast becoming, under the
weight of Imperial taxation for Imperial schemes, an extinct
race.</p>
<h3><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>OUR
KAFFIR WARS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Writing</span> last year, Captain Aylward,
in his work on the Transvaal, indicated that South Africa would
be a burning question for the British taxpayer in the summer of
1879.&nbsp; That period of time has not yet arrived, but already
the question has come home to the aggrieved individual aforesaid
in an unpleasantly novel and alarming manner.&nbsp; In spite of
instructions from home, Sir Bartle Frere has initiated an
aggressive war on the Zulu nation which already represents an
expenditure of a million and a half, and which, before it is
fought out to the bitter end, will occasion the expenditure of a
much larger sum.&nbsp; In a time of unexampled commercial
distress, when thousands of homes have been made desolate; when
tender and delicate women who have been nursed in luxury and
comfort have been deprived of their daily bread; when grey-haired
old men have found themselves after the struggle of a life made
paupers; when the most the majority of us can do is to meet the
inevitable expenditure of the passing day&mdash;we are committed,
in accordance with the Imperial instincts of officials in high
quarters, to a warlike policy of which none can tell the result
or calculate the cost.&nbsp; This, alas! is no new thing where
our South African colonies are concerned.&nbsp; A war is begun by
a blundering ruler, or in accordance with the wishes of
interested parties, and the ignorant public at home has to pay
the bill.&nbsp; Sir Arthur Cunynghame, in his last work,
expresses the hope that for the Kaffir wars which were in
existence when he was at the Cape the British taxpayer would not
have to pay; nevertheless, in the Budget &pound;344,000 are put
down for the Transkei war.&nbsp; Mr. Trollope goes a step
further, and plainly shows that the colonist, whether as farmer
or labourer or trader, is much better off than men of the same
class at home, and that it is unjust we should be taxed by an
immense military expenditure for their benefit alone.&nbsp;
Speaking of the Transvaal, he adds, &ldquo;Great as is the
parliamentary strength of the present Ministry, Parliament would
hardly endure the idea of paying permanently for the stability
and security of a Dutch population out of the British
pocket.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet in Natal the <i>Daily News</i>
correspondent estimates that our war with Cetewayo will cost
twelve millions.&nbsp; It is to be questioned whether we as a
people have been pecuniarly benefited by South African
colonies.&nbsp; They offer no such advantages as a field of
emigration as New Zealand or Canada or Australia.&nbsp; The
emigrant is afraid of a Kaffir war, and he goes elsewhere.&nbsp;
If the colonists had to pay for their own wars, we should <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>have had
fewer of them, and by this time they would have been in a much
more flourishing condition.&nbsp; Nor should we have been
trembling, as we have of late, lest any morning we might hear the
Zulu army had marched into Natal and had not left a white man
alive to tell the tale of the terrible tragedy that ensued.&nbsp;
I maintain there would be no end to these Kaffir scares and
Kaffir wars so long as the men and money of the mother country
are so employed, and so long as the colonial governors are
allowed to rush into war.&nbsp; If a man goes to live in South
Africa he should do so with the feeling that he runs a certain
risk, and that knowledge would make him live on good terms with
the natives.&nbsp; High interest, as the late Duke of Wellington
is reported to have said, means bad security.&nbsp; In a similar
manner, we may say, cheap land means bad security; and the farmer
who buys the freehold of his farm in Natal for less than the rent
he has to pay for it at home cannot expect to be as secure in
purse or person as a farmer in the Weald of Kent.&nbsp; In 1811
was our first Kaffir war.&nbsp; It was waged on our part in the
most cruel manner&mdash;no quarter was given by the white
man&mdash;no prisoners taken&mdash;all were slaughtered till the
Kaffirs were driven backwards and eastwards across the Great Fish
River.&nbsp; In 1819 we had another fight, as was to be
expected.&nbsp; Wars lead to wars.&nbsp; What the sword wins the
sword only can retain.&nbsp; Lord Charles Somerset, who had
Imperial ideas of the most pronounced character, took it into his
head to elect Gaika as the sole head of Kaffirland, when in
reality the paramount chief was Hintza.&nbsp; In 1818, by seizing
the wife of one of the latter&rsquo;s chief councillors, and
other aggressive acts, Gaika drew upon himself the enmity of his
superior, and was defeated in a fierce battle with great
slaughter.&nbsp; After the defeat Gaika appealed to the British
Government to assist him, not in bringing about a reconciliation,
but in making war on his enemies.&nbsp; Accordingly a powerful
force of regular troops and armed colonists, to the number of
3,352 men, under Colonel Brereton, was despatched to fight on
behalf of this wretched savage.&nbsp; The reward of their valour
consisted in more than 30,000 head of cattle, of which 21,000 of
the finest were given to the colonists and the rest to
Gaika.&nbsp; As a natural consequence, the plundered tribes,
rendered desperate by famine, crossed the Fish River in great
numbers, drove in the small military posts, and compelled the
border colonists to abandon their dwellings.&nbsp; Additional
troops were sent to the frontier, and a plan was formed for the
re-invasion of Kaffirland.&nbsp; But before that plan was carried
out, the Kaffirs, to the number of 9,000, led by Makanna,
attacked Grahamstown, and would have taken it had not the leader,
in accordance with the custom of the heroes of his country, sent
a message overnight to inform Colonel Willshire, the <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>British
commandant, that he would breakfast with him next morning.&nbsp;
This gave the British time to prepare, and the result was 1,400
Kaffirs were left dead on the field.&nbsp; After this Colonel
Willshire and Landdrost Stockenstrom advanced into the
enemy&rsquo;s country, carrying fire and slaughter
everywhere.&nbsp; At length Makanna, to obtain better terms for
his people, freely surrendered himself into the hands of the
English; but this act had no effect on the latter, who proceeded
to drive away the Kaffirs and to annex 3,000 square miles of
fertile territory.&nbsp; The Kaffir, of course, became more
incensed against us than ever.&nbsp; He saw his lands taken away,
and an inferior chief placed, as it were, in power; but for a
while, however, we had no regular fighting, only occasional
brushes in consequence of cattle stealing, real or
pretended.&nbsp; There is a foray recorded in the Cape Government
Gazette of 1823 as a very meritorious affair.&nbsp; At daybreak
on the 5th, Major Somerset, having collected his force, passed
with celerity along a ridge, and at daylight had the satisfaction
of pouring into the centre of Makanna&rsquo;s kraal with a
rapidity that at once astonished and completely overset the
Kaffirs.&nbsp; A few assegais were thrown, but the attack was
made with such vigour that little resistance could be made.&nbsp;
<i>As many Kaffirs having been destroyed as it was thought would
evince our superiority and power</i>, Major Somerset stopped the
slaughter, and secured the cattle to the amount of about 7,000
head.</p>
<p>Strange to say, this mode of impressing the Kaffir with the
fact of our superiority and power only made matters worse, and
the commissioners of inquiry had to report, in July, 1825, that
the annexation had entailed expenses upon the Government and
sacrifices upon the people in no degree compensated with the
acquirement of the territory which was the object of it.&nbsp; A
similar remark may be made at the present time, for, as soon as a
colony gets strong enough, its first effort is to fight the
mother country with a hostile tariff.&nbsp; It seems then, as
now, nothing was easier than to get up a <i>casus
belli</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Baines, the great African traveller,
illustrates in an amusing manner what is meant by justice to the
natives by some of our colonists.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was speaking to
a friend,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;respecting the new
discoveries, and we both agreed that it would be wrong to make
war upon the natives and take the gold-fields away from
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;I
would work with foresight.&nbsp; I would send cattle farmers to
graze their herds near the borders, and the Kaffirs would be sure
to steal them; but, if not, the owner could come away, and he
could even withdraw his herdsmen and let them run night and day,
then the Kaffirs could not resist the temptation.&nbsp; We could
go in and claim the stolen cattle, and, if the Kaffirs resisted
and made war, of course they would lose their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Our
next Kaffir war was, as all our Kaffir wars were, discreditable
to ourselves.&nbsp; The war was not only, writes Mr. Trollope,
bloody, but ruinous to thousands.&nbsp; The cattle were of course
destroyed, so that no one was enriched.&nbsp; Of the ill blood
then engendered the effects still remain.&nbsp; Three hundred
thousand pounds were spent by the British.&nbsp; But at last the
Kaffirs were supposed to have been conquered, and Sir Benjamin
D&rsquo;Urban triumphant.&nbsp; Lord Glenelg himself, however,
declared that the Kaffirs had &ldquo;ample
justification.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems to an impartial observer
that the war was entirely brought about by the English.&nbsp;
After his expulsion from the Kat river, Macomo, the son of Gaika,
retired to the banks of the Chumie, but so far from instigating
his people to plunder the colony, he appears to have done his
best to restrain them.&nbsp; On that head we have abundant
testimony, but it suited the Colonial Governor to have him and
his brother Tyalie removed, and removed they were under really
aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; Our own soldiers did their work
well, and we have graphic pictures of burning villages, ruined
cultivations, and people driven away like wild beasts.&nbsp; The
chief was sulky, writes Colonel Wade, and well he might be.&nbsp;
Another cause of the war was the frontier system, which
constantly led to collisions with the natives.&nbsp; As the Chief
Tyalie declared, &ldquo;Every year a commando comes, every week a
patrol comes, every day farmers come and seize our
cattle.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was then the infuriated natives swept
over the colony, to be in turn driven back.&nbsp; The murder of
the great chief Hintza appears to have been an extraordinarily
brutal one.&nbsp; It is stated to me, writes Lord Glenelg,
&ldquo;that Hintza repeatedly cried for mercy, that the
Hottentots present granted the boon, and abstained from killing
him; that this office was then undertaken by Mr. Southey, and
that then the dead body of the fallen chief was basely and
inhumanly mutilated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Sir Peregrine Maitland we had a fourth Kaffir war.&nbsp;
Almost his first act was to commit an unpardonable sin in Kaffir
eyes&mdash;the erection of a fort in their territory.&nbsp; As
they said in their own expressive language, the new chief smelt
of war, and war soon came.&nbsp; A Kaffir stole an axe; he was
sent to Grahamstown to be tried at the circuit court.&nbsp; The
chief Tola said that was contrary to the treaty that all such
offences were to be tried at Fort Beaufort.&nbsp; The plea was in
vain&mdash;the man was sent; an attempt was made to rescue him,
and a Hottentot policeman was shot.&nbsp; At once the English
took the field to avenge the insult in blood.</p>
<p>In 1850 the fifth Kaffir war arose, and the inhabitants of one
advanced military village after another were murdered.&nbsp; This
went on for nearly two years, but was at last suppressed by dint
of hard fighting.&nbsp; It cost Great Britain, wrote Mr.
Trollope, upwards of <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>two millions of money, with the lives
of about four hundred fighting men.</p>
<p>Our Natal territory cost us a little war initiated by Sir
George Napier in 1841.&nbsp; At first the war went very much in
favour of the Dutch.&nbsp; Then a larger force came, and the
Dutch succumbed to numbers.&nbsp; It was not, however, till 1843
that the twenty-four still existing members of the Volksraad
declared Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to be supreme.&nbsp; In
the case of the Orange Free State we had a war which resulted in
our beating the Dutch and winning the place, only to relinquish
it again.&nbsp; Our rule in Natal led to our little war with King
Langalibalele, who had come to live in Natal as king of the Hlubi
tribe, who is now living, after a good many lives had been lost,
near Capetown at an expense to the Government of &pound;500 a
year.&nbsp; In England it was felt that the chief had been
unfairly used, the trial was adjudged to have been conducted with
over-strained rigour, and the punishment to have been too
severe.&nbsp; There would have been no war at all had it not been
for the blunders of mischievous go-betweens.&nbsp; And now once
more we are at war, and a cry has been raised for the
extermination of the whole Zulu race; and when that is over,
there will be fresh hordes of hostile natives to be fought, new
lands to be annexed, a scientific frontier to be gained, and the
colonists will make fortunes out of the millions thus
spent.&nbsp; I ask in sorrow, How long is England to be strained
and denuded of men and money for these costly wars?&nbsp; Surely
it is a reproach alike to the Christianity and statesmanship of
our time that we have not yet hit on a more excellent way.</p>
<h3><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>A PLEA
FOR THE KAFFIR.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the present moment we are
witnessing a sorry spectacle for a Christian nation&mdash;that of
a whole people hemmed in in one corner of Eastern Africa, waiting
to be swept off the face of the earth by the finest soldiers and
the most scientific instruments of murder England has at her
command.&nbsp; Their crime has been that in defending their
native soil from the tread of the foe, they annihilated an
English regiment, and for such an act there is no hope of pardon,
in this world at least.&nbsp; From every corner of the land, from
the pulpit and the Press, from the hut of the peasant and the
palace of the prince, from the cad of the music-hall and the
statesman of Downing Street, there has risen a cry for revenge;
and that we shall take a full and fierce revenge there can be no
doubt.&nbsp; Already in England and in Africa the blood-stained
demon of war has sown her seed and reaps her harvest; already
there have been bitter tears shed over hundreds of fallen heroes
in desolated homes, and women wail and children vainly cry for
loved ones whose bones now bleach the distant plain of
Isandula.&nbsp; And there will be sadder and darker tragedies yet
to come if the wild instincts of the people are to be gratified
and the Zulu Kaffirs are to be exterminated.&nbsp; They are now
represented as savage hordes, whose existence is incompatible
with English rule.&nbsp; Let me plead that they are not such as
they are represented, and that it is better that we make them
friends.&nbsp; Cetewayo, by not crossing the Tugela and sweeping
with fire and slaughter through Natal when that colony lay
stricken and terrified at his feet, has set us an example of
forbearance which it were wise to imitate.&nbsp; If we fail to do
so, the blood feud between us and his people can know no
end.&nbsp; They in their turn will nurse a spirit of revenge, and
the Kaffir wars of the future will be fiercer and more cruel than
any we have hitherto known.</p>
<p>There is much in the Kaffirs that should make them friendly
with the English people if fairly treated.&nbsp; One well-known
writer states that they are keen observers of character, and have
great contempt for a man who gets drunk, or who does not keep his
word.&nbsp; Kaffirs should be treated with kindness, fairness,
and firmness.&nbsp; They have an accurate idea of justice, and
appreciate the administration of just legislation, wrote Mr.
Wilson, late a resident magistrate in Natal.&nbsp; In their wild
state they are innocent, quiet, unoffending, and hospitable, and
it is only when they live close to a European town that they
acquire the bad <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>habits of the white race, and with the cunning instincts
natural to them become dangerous to the community.&nbsp; Said
another colonist, at a conference recently held at the African
section of the Society of Arts, mentally they were equal to white
men.&nbsp; Dr. Mann, who has lived twenty-five years in Natal,
and who has written a large work on that colony, declares that
the Kaffirs had great ability, and, even without education,
seemed a much higher race intellectually than the lower class of
the agricultural population in England.&nbsp; In fact, he would
rather go to a Kaffir for a response to an appeal to his reason
than to an English labourer.&nbsp; Twenty years ago, said Mr.
Richardes, they brought comparatively nothing, but now they were
great customers to the British merchant.&nbsp; As a further proof
of how a Zulu Kaffir could rise in the world, Dr. Mann mentions
the case of one he knew who could not read, who borrowed on his
own credit &pound;500 to buy a sugar mill, and obtained a further
loan from the Government to get it to work, and who, in three
years, paid off the loan, and became a prosperous
manufacturer.&nbsp; It seems a pity to kill off such
people&mdash;a people by nature intended to be our customers and
allies and friends.&nbsp; Much more than this may be said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kaffirs seem,&rdquo; writes Lady Barker, &ldquo;a very gay
and cheerful people, to judge by the laughter and jests I hear
from the groups returning to their kraals every day by the road
just outside our fence.&rdquo;&nbsp; A similar testimony was
borne by Mr. Robert Richardson in a paper read by him a year or
two since at a meeting of the Society of Arts.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Zulu,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may not be dignified, but manliness
and good temper are written on his cheerful countenance; and he
is not only groom and cattle herd, but domestic servant, and
performs with alacrity the least honourable service about a
house.&nbsp; If Natal lambs don&rsquo;t skip, as the
Surveyor-General once said, at least the Natal servant does, for
his errands are done at a trot cutting capers, while he sings
with an appearance of great enjoyment in his own music.&nbsp;
Brimful of humour, he is essentially a laughing animal, and
having few wants or comforts, he rivals Mark Tapley in being
jolly under creditable circumstances.&nbsp; All things
considered, the Natal Zulu is a better servant than the (Cape)
frontier Kaffir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is much that is good in these Kaffirs.&nbsp; A
correspondent of the <i>Cape Mercury</i> wrote&mdash;&ldquo;It is
said the Kaffir language has no word for gratitude; but,
nevertheless, the Kaffirs are not all void of it.&nbsp; A native
man in good circumstances lent a brick waggon gratis to convey
Mr. Conway and family to the house of his father-in-law, Mr.
Conway being at the time very ill.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after his
arrival, he died, leaving his wife and family not very well
off.&nbsp; The other day the native arrived to take <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>home his
waggon which he had kindly lent, and found that if he took it he
would leave Mrs. Conway without any means to make an independent
living.&nbsp; To the astonishment of all present, he said,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t forget good deeds done to me by Conway
before poverty overhauled him, and to show that I am sincerely
sorry for his family I here make you, his widow, a present of my
waggon and gear now in your possession to enable you to provide
for his children.&rsquo;&nbsp; The value of the waggon was
&pound;60.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In contrast with this is the utter indifference displayed by
too many colonists as to the welfare of the Kaffirs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The other day,&rdquo; says a writer in a Colonial paper
called the <i>Independent</i>, &ldquo;a wheelbarrow tumbled over
the Kimberley (Diamond fields) reef on to the head of a
Kaffir.&nbsp; His master, with some irritation, inquired of the
employer of the careless servant, &lsquo;Do you want to kill my
Kaffirs?&rsquo;&nbsp; The reply was an indignant query,
&lsquo;What about my wheelbarrow?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s smashed, and
your Kaffir isn&rsquo;t hurt.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But enough of this.&nbsp; According to all writers the Kaffir
is deeply impressed with a sense of English superiority.&nbsp;
Let us now show him our true superiority; that we war not with
him, that we desire not his land, that we are as merciful as we
are strong.&nbsp; Cetewayo&rsquo;s young men have washed their
spears in blood, and ours have fallen under circumstances which
have created an abiding sense of their heroism in every Zulu
breast.&nbsp; Have we no wise men among us who can stand between
the living and the dead, and calm the natural passions of the
hour, and stay the ravages of war?&nbsp; If there be not such,
our task is an endless one to fight and conquer, merely to fight
and conquer again.&nbsp; The soldier cannot solve the difficulty;
he merely postpones it for a time.</p>
<p>Failing to do justice to the Kaffirs we are left to a very
undesirable alternative.&nbsp; If we cease to rule by kindness,
we must do so by brute force.&nbsp; Contemplating this delightful
state of things, the <i>Natal Witness</i> of the 8th of February
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Civilisation has become unmistakably
aggressive.&nbsp; The result which it was hoped might be gained
by the quiet influence of the plough-share and the railway, is
now destined to be effected, under the guidance of Sir Bartle
Frere, at the point of the bayonet.&nbsp; The great herald of
peace, whose feet were to be so beautiful upon the mountains, has
become the genius of war.&nbsp; Whether Sir Bartle Frere foresaw
this, we are not aware, nor are we aware whether he likes his
position.&nbsp; We will not even argue whether he is right or
wrong in believing that civilisation must be aggressive.&nbsp;
Judging by history, we incline to the opinion that he is right,
and if he is right, then the hope of producing the social
amalgamation we have referred to was a vain hope
altogether.&nbsp; But whether it is a vain hope or not, let us
not deceive ourselves about one thing&mdash;that it is now
extinguished.&nbsp; <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>The ship of State has been put about on the other tack,
and is at the present moment, it must be owned, making very bad
weather of it.&nbsp; Whatever is now done by way of civilising
the native population in South Africa must be done by
force.&nbsp; We do not necessarily mean such physical force as is
employed in a pitched battle.&nbsp; We mean rather
this&mdash;that the native population must henceforth be ruled by
a show of military strength rather than by trust in British
justice or regard for commercial advantages.&nbsp; This, we say,
may be right; it may in the very nature of things have been
unavoidable.&nbsp; But do not let us deceive ourselves about
it.&nbsp; The fact is so, and we must make the best of it or the
worst.&nbsp; If the Home Government will be content to keep a
large military force in South Africa for thirty years to come,
and if South Africa can afford to pay for it; or if, failing
this, the British taxpayer will be kind enough to pay for the
protection of the colonies which will not be worth protecting if
he does not pay&mdash;if all this comes to pass, then for thirty
years South Africa will be a place which, though utterly useless
as a field for immigration, a place in which certain classes of
people can live.&nbsp; But then will these things be done?&nbsp;
Will England be content to keep such a body of troops in South
Africa?&nbsp; Can South Africa pay for them?&nbsp; And, if South
Africa cannot, will the British public pay?&nbsp; These are
questions most seriously affecting our future, and which for the
present we leave to be answered by our readers as best they may
be able.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is a colonial aspect of what is
emphatically a colonial question.</p>
<p>We hear in these days so much about the Zulu that we are apt
to forget that in South Africa we have any one else to deal
with.&nbsp; In fact the coloured people with whom our whites more
or less come into contact, are estimated by Mr. Trollope, our
best authority on the subject, at 3,000,000, and with the
exception of the Korannas, and the Bushmen, who inhabit
Namaqualand, a region where only copper is to be found, are a
very superior race of men, well-built, with good capabilities,
mental and physical.&nbsp; It is to be questioned whether the
danger in the recent system of government at the Cape, which
places power in the hands of the white colonists alone, is not
calculated to create discontent among the numerous and
high-spirited people around.&nbsp; It is much to be regretted
also, that we have not yet been able to adopt a steady and
consistent policy with the native tribes.&nbsp; The great
civilising agency of our time is the British trader, and at the
Kimberley mines he has set the native to work; but more than that
is required if the native is to be elevated and to be taught to
take his proper place as a labourer in the great harvests of the
world.</p>
<p>If the reader looks at a map of South Africa he will find that
it <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>is
divided, into many districts, some of them of immense
extent&mdash;hundreds of miles apart, and inhabited by peoples
under varying rulers, and with varying interests.&nbsp; The Cape,
for instance, has little sympathy with Natal, and the great
Namaqualand has little in common with the Transvaal.&nbsp; In the
latter country, as is well known, we have a community hostile to
English rule, while the Orange Free State, on each side hemmed in
by English dominions, maintains a precarious independency of its
own.&nbsp; A grand South African confederation is a beautiful
idea, but there does not seem much chance of carrying it out just
now.&nbsp; Meanwhile we go on annexing all the surrounding
country, much to the discontent of the natives themselves.</p>
<p>At present the great difficulty is the native
population.&nbsp; According to all accounts, they are in an
unsettled and agitated state.&nbsp; Of the original Hottentot we
do not hear much.&nbsp; Mr. Trollope believes that the bulk of
the population of the Western Province of the Cape Colony is
Hottentot, who has, however, long given up all idea of
independence.&nbsp; The Dutchmen and the Englishmen also, who are
to be met with in the East and West alike, are not likely to give
much trouble; but as we get further from the Cape, and the white
population is sparser, the difficulties increase.&nbsp; It is
true there is no chance of a Kaffir scare in that part of Africa
bordering on the Atlantic, nor in the Kalakari desert on the
North is there any danger to be apprehended; but it is as we get
nearer the Indian Ocean, and especially after we have crossed the
Kei, and come into Kaffraria proper, that we find ourselves in
the presence of a native population, always required to be
watched with a careful eye.&nbsp; There dwell the Galekas, who,
to the number of 66,000, under Kreli, have only recently been put
down.&nbsp; They and the Tembus, and the Pondos, and the
Bomvanas, and the Fingos, inhabit all the district till Natal is
reached.&nbsp; Amongst some of them a British Resident resides;
in all they do pretty much as they like.&nbsp; Of Natal and its
300,000 Kaffirs it is needless to say more here.&nbsp; In the
same neighbourhood are the Griquas, but they are bastard
races.&nbsp; The Balongas of Thaba &rsquo;Ncho, who dwell under
the shelter of the Orange Free State, and the Basutos, are a
branch of the Becuanas, who inhabit that part of the Kalakari
desert bordering on Griqualand and the Transvaal.&nbsp; Of the
black African races, the South-Eastern people whom we call
Kaffirs and Zulus are, probably, the best.&nbsp; They are not
constitutionally cruel; they learn to work readily, and they save
property; but even at the Cape, where they will have power at the
voting-booth, Mr. Bowker, the late commandant of the Frontier
Mounted Police, says&mdash;&ldquo;As a nation, they hate the
white man, and look forward to the day when he will be expelled
from the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Trollope remarks of the native
that he is a <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>good-humoured fellow, whether by nature a hostile
Kaffir, or submissive Fingo, or friendly Basuto, but, if occasion
should arise, he would probably be a rebel.&nbsp; The two names
most familiar to the English readers are the Gaikas and Galekas,
who have both given us a good deal of trouble.&nbsp; Sandilli
with his Gaikas have long been subjected, though they have never
been regarded as peaceable as the Fingos and the Basutos.&nbsp;
The total population of the region beyond the Kei is stated to be
500,100, of whom, with the small exception of the Griquas, all
are Kaffirs.</p>
<p>Our special friends among the natives are the Fingos, a tribe
originally driven from Natal by the warrior Chaka, among the
Galekas, by whom they were enslaved and regarded as Kaffir
dogs.&nbsp; We English took pity on them, released them from
slavery, and settled them somewhere near the coast between the
great Fish River and the Keishamma, and their old masters, the
Galekas.&nbsp; There they were a perpetual eyesore to their
former masters.&nbsp; In the first place, they had for their
50,000 souls 2,000 square miles, while that left for the 66,000
Galekas was not more than 1,600 miles.&nbsp; Again, the Fingos
have been a money-making people, possessing oxen and waggons, and
gradually rising in the world.&nbsp; For a time, as was to be
expected, mischief between the two tribes was brewing, and in
1877 a drunken row precipitated the two into war.&nbsp; We rushed
into the war to defend the Fingos, and Kreli, who had no desire
for a struggle with the English, was beaten, and his country
annexed.&nbsp; The Basutos, who have given up fighting since the
days of their great king Moshesh, number about 127,000.&nbsp; In
the map they are now included in the Cape Province, but they
border the Orange Free State&mdash;lying between it and
Kaffraria.&nbsp; In 1868 they became, after a wearisome contest
with the Dutch, so worried by the latter, that they implored the
British to take them as subjects.&nbsp; The Basutos are not
Kaffirs, but a branch of the Bechuanas, as are the Balongas, who
live so peacefully under the shelter of the Dutch in the Orange
Free State.&nbsp; As their land is the very best on the Continent
for agricultural purposes, they have bought a great many ploughs,
are great growers of corn and wool, and naturally, as is the case
with such people, are friends of peace and great lovers of
money.&nbsp; At one time they were cannibals.&nbsp; For a long
time they were terrible fighters, and that they have become what
they are may be quoted as a fine testimony to the civilising
influences of the trader.&nbsp; At the same time, it will not be
difficult to make enemies of them.&nbsp; One of their
chiefs&mdash;Morosi&mdash;has, taking advantage of the Zulu war,
attempted a little <i>emeute</i> on his own hook.&nbsp; We are
glad to find, as was to be expected, that he has got the worst of
it.&nbsp; In a letter dated March 1, from Alrival North, the
writer says:&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder the Government are not more
active <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>in
their movements, and send a proper force to crush him at once, as
it is believed here that if Morosi gets the least advantage the
whole of Basutoland will be in a blaze.&nbsp; Sprigg will find
that the Disarming Act will cost the colony more than he
expected, and the Basutos, who are supposed to be loyal, are not
at all inclined to give up their arms, and I am sure will not do
so without a struggle.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Gaikas who inhabit the
district around Frankfort and King William&rsquo;s-town have been
British subjects for five-and-twenty years; but it is said that
our recent policy has also much alienated them.&nbsp; These are
the men on whose future relationship depends the fate of South
Africa.&nbsp; Under his own chief in the forest, says Mr. Froude,
the Kaffir is at least a man trained and disciplined; under
European authority he might become as fine a specimen of manhood
as an Irish or English policeman.&nbsp; It is to our shame that
we have left him almost entirely to himself, and that even our
missionaries have done little more than teach him to sing
hymns.&nbsp; Lovedale is, however, an important testimony to the
worth of missionary enterprise when it takes an industrious
turn.&nbsp; There carpentering, waggon-making, blacksmithing,
printing, book-binding, cabinet-making, and farm work are all
successfully carried on.&nbsp; At King William&rsquo;s-town young
native men, trained at Lovedale, may be found employed as writers
in attorneys&rsquo; offices, steadily performing their work, and
with satisfaction to their employers.&nbsp; At Edendale the Rev.
James Allison commenced a still greater work.&nbsp; He bought a
block of land near Maritsburgh, and divided it into sections
suitable to humble purchasers.&nbsp; These purchasers were
natives; his conditions were payment for these lands by
instalments, and the complete surrender of polygamy.&nbsp; The
people are described as industrious and prosperous, they
subscribe to build their own chapels, and when their numbers
increase beyond what the land will fairly support, they swarm out
and purchase land elsewhere.&nbsp; 8,000 acres are thus planted,
with 2,000 inhabitants.&nbsp; If we are to believe the Rev. Mr.
Carlyle, formerly the Presbyterian chaplain at Natal, nowhere has
the missionary been more successful than in South Africa.</p>

BARNARDO&rsquo;S<br />
HOMES FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN.</h1>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>EAST-END JUVENILE
MISSION</i>.)</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">URGENT APPEAL.</p>
<p>In the East of London, situated in three parishes, and
surrounded by a dense population, are the various Institutions
comprehended under the name of the <span class="smcap">East-End
Juvenile Mission</span>.&nbsp; These include the Refuges for
Destitute and Neglected Children usually called after their
founder, &ldquo;Dr. Barnardo&rsquo;s Homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The East-End Juvenile Mission was for many years under the
sole direction of its founder, but during the past few months a
Committee has undertaken, in conjunction with him, its financial
control and general administration.</p>
<p>As very few who have heard of the Homes can have any adequate
idea of the great variety of work comprehended by this Mission,
or of its weighty claims upon the contributions of the
benevolent, we may be permitted to briefly state its more
important branches.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The old building known as the <span
class="smcap">Home for Working and Destitute Lads</span>, in
Stepney Causeway, contains at present about 260 boys; whilst a
new building is being reared in the same locality, and when
finished the whole will accommodate 400 otherwise homeless or
orphan boys.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Destitute Orphan or Neglected
Girls</span> are also cared for by this Mission, and are trained
upon the <i>family system</i>, which is, in many respects,
preferable to the old method of massing together large numbers of
female children in one great Institution.&nbsp; In the <span
class="smcap">Village Home</span> at Ilford there are now
twenty-four little Cottages, each detached from its neighbours,
and superintended by a Christian woman specially selected for the
performance of her important duties.&nbsp; These Cottages are
intended to contain respectively from fifteen to twenty little
orphan or destitute girls, who are being trained therein for
domestic service.&nbsp; When the <span
class="smcap">Village</span> is completed and fully occupied
there will be thirty Cottages, calculated to contain about 600
such children.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; An <span class="smcap">Infirmary for Sick
Children</span>, containing thirty beds, has also been opened in
Stepney Causeway, and is worked in connection with the other
Institutions.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A most important and practical Temperance work has
also been established and carried on by this Mission.&nbsp; The
first <span class="smcap">Coffee Palace</span> in the Metropolis,
the &ldquo;Edinburgh Castle,&rdquo; was founded by Dr. Barnardo
in Limehouse, in February, 1873.&nbsp; The success which attended
it and its fellow, the &ldquo;Dublin Castle,&rdquo; situated in
Mile-end, has, in a large measure, led to the establishment of
other Institutions of a similar character.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Free Ragged Schools</span> of
the Mission contained every Sunday about 1,700 children, gathered
from the poorest streets of Limehouse, whilst two <span
class="smcap">Large Mission Halls</span>, situated in the midst
of the adult population, and seating 2,500 persons, are on Sunday
crowded by the working classes, who throng to hear in them
earnest evangelical addresses.&nbsp; These varied religious and
temperance efforts, among <i>adults</i>, as well as the
educational and refuge work among <i>destitute children</i>, need
a considerable sum of money for their support.</p>
<p>During the past year the pressing needs of these Institutions,
owing to extraordinary expenses in building, were only met by
obtaining from the bankers an advance of &pound;6,000.&nbsp; The
Committee are now most anxious to repay that sum, and with this
object appeal to the benevolently disposed for assistance to
remove from these valuable Institutions the burden of debt under
which they are labouring for the first time since their
establishment in 1867.</p>
<p>Contributions in response to this appeal may be sent to the
Bankers of the Institution, Messrs. Dimsdale, Fowler, and Co.,
50, Cornhill; or the London and South-Western Bank, Bow Branch;
and will be gratefully acknowledged by the Honorary Director, Dr.
Barnardo, at the Office of the Institution, 18, Stepney Causeway,

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
